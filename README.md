Simple game 2048

  This is my the first serious program on Java. I create it on 20.03.2016, after few month learning Java. At that time this game 
by Gabriele Cirulli was very actual and I like it very much.  So I decide to create it by myself. From original game I take only idea. 
All movements and algorithms I invented myself and it didn't stolen from original game.
  At that moment I even don't hear about Java Code Conventions. That why do not judge strictly.
  Game completely build on javax.swing.
